# funtu
The funtu project is a small idea that will allow the automation of 'scraping' OSINT sites to record and store known malicious external endpoints into a central repository, allowing security analysis to take place on pcaps.

This is in extremely early stages of developemt.

funtu takes it's name from "Fun Hunting You".  Any associations with any other words are your own perceptions ;o)
